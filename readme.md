## Task 1 #

A string is given (encoded in UTF-8). Find the most frequent symbol in it. If several characters are found equally often, then any one can be displayed.
Asymptotic complexity of the resulting algorithm: O (N + k) = O (N), where k is the number of different characters in string.

## Task 2 #

Find the sum of the entered sequence of numbers—é
Asymptotic complexity of the resulting algorithm: O (N)

## Task 3 #

Find the maximum of the entered sequence of numbers
Asymptotic complexity of the resulting algorithm: O (N)

## Task 4 #

Given three integers a, b, c. Find all roots of the equation ax ^ 2 + bx + c = 0 and print them in ascending order
Asymptotic complexity of the resulting algorithm: O (1)
